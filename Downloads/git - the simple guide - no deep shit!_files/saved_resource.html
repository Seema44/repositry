<p>so maybe I'm misuderstanding git..but I have a working directory with one  file in it, and I made a branch named "develop" to modify that file which involved breaking it for awhile. however, I just realized that if I git checkout between my master and develop branch, that file is exactly the same in both branches, ie what's the point of making a separate branch to test changes in if it's modifying the file in my master branch as well? was surprised that happened, maybe I'm doing something wrong?</p>

<p>The way I look at branches is that they are pointers to commits or snapshots you have made. When you create and checkout the new branch, you're only going to move the "develop" pointer forward. Once you checkout the master branch, you're moving the "master" pointer each time you make a commit.</p><p>To make the master and develop branches the exact same you either had to have merged the two branches together or mistakenly made changes on the wrong branch.</p><p>One important point to remember is that creating a new branch doesn't automatically checkout that branch. You need to run "git branch develop" then "git checkout develop" or run "git checkout -b develop".</p>

<p>maybe I accidentally did it without checking out to a different branch, I'm not sure. So, if I'm in my working directory (the local folder on my actual computer) where I initialized git, and I git checkout to a new branch, then I open and edit my file (in the new branch) in my text editor, save it and exit out..how does git tell the actual local file that it's supposed to have two instances? (on two separate branches). In that scenario, the only file that should have the changes is the one that's in the branch I edited it from, correct?</p>

<p>can you be specific when git asked you to stash your changes.</p><p>In general, stashing by "git stash" removes all changes from staging area  and modified area and are saved it .git folder. You'll then have a clean slate without any changes. You need not worry about all your changes, you can reapply them using "git stash apply"</p>
